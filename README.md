# Data Driven Detection of Isolated Mass Gap Black Holes


## File Structure

 - How to run the code

    - run `preprocess.py`
    - run `visualization.py`
    - run `model.py`
    - run `evaluation.py`

 - What each file does

    - `Main_notebook.ipynb`: main jupyter notebook with all code in one place - easy for viewing and running code
    - `preprocess.py`: Preprocess data for visualization
    - `visualization.py`: Visualize data
    - `model.py`: Create Tensorflow Deep Neural Network
    - `evaluation.py`: Evaluate the model

 - Saved Model: model is saved in tensorflow default format: can be loaded and used as shown in `evaluation.py`
